# Implemented RFCs

Putting an RFC file here marks the RFC as _active_. Active RFCs are the ones
that have been approved and are under implementation. They are move here by the
TSC.

Ideally active RFCs should have a link to a corresponding tracking issue, GitHub
project, or draft pull request in the repository it concerns.
