# Deferred RFCs

Putting an RFC file here marks the RFC as deferred. This means, the RFC is
approved, but nobody is currently working on its implementation.

If you would like to pick up an RFC here and implement it, please open a
tracking issue in the corresponding repository the RFC is for and open a pull
request here that

- moves the RFC into the `active/` directory
- links the tracking issue from the RFC
