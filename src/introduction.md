# Introduction

This book collects the approved RFCs for the seL4 ecosystem.

The seL4 foundation uses the request for comments (RFC) process to

- allow the community to discuss design changes in seL4,
- gather valuable feedback from the community on changes the foundation is
  considering,
- allow members of the seL4 community to get support and approval to propose and
  implement their own changes to the seL4 ecosystem,
- ensure that all changes made to core components of the seL4 ecosystem or that
  have wide and varying impacts on users of seL4 undergo rigorous review, and
- ensure large changes are well advertised and can viewed publicly before
  contributors commit to implementing them.

This helps the seL4 community ensure that such changes are made with the goal of
the best outcome for the most users of seL4 without compromising seL4's
high-assurance properties of functional correctness, isolation, and security.

The RFCs in this book are split into three parts: _Implemented_ RFCs are
completed and available for use. _Active_ RFCs are approved and currently under
implementation. _Deferred_ RFCs are approved, but currently not being worked on
for implementation.
