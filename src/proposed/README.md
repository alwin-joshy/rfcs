# Proposed RFC under discussion

When you open an new pull request for an RFC, put your RFC file(s) here.

Usually an RFC is a single markdown file such as `0170-multikernel-ipi-api.md`.
For adding images and diagrams, the layout is recommended:

```sh
0170-multikernel-ipi-api.md
0170-multikernel-ipi-api/diagram.svg
0170-multikernel-ipi-api/image.png
```

> [!NOTE]
> The number prefix, e.g. `0170` above is not a key or ID for the RFC, it is
> used to order the RFCs in generated RFC book and may change over time. For
> a new RFC, pick a new number that is larger than any other number in use. Keep
> the last digit at 0.
